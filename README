No compilation needed, simply cd to the directory containing this 
software's executable and execute a command of the following form:

    ./p4500 -f <pathname> -f <pathname>

This software is written in the Python programming langauge and 
depends on the following standard libraries: numpy, wave, sys, struct, scipy, 
subprocess, and math.

To improve on our prototype the following changes will be made:
 1) Improve our comparison method by increasing the thoroughness with which
    we compare the two files
 2) Expand our program to handle an arbitrary number of input files.
 3) Remove any egregiously inefficient code.
